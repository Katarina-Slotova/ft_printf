# ft_printf
Because Iâ€™m tired of using putnbr and putstr.

Regardless of the programming language considered, the printf function,(or its equivalents) is always highly useful. The main reason is the ease of its formatting, and the support of diverse types in variable numbers. Some variations even propose to be able to write the resulting string of characters either in a file descriptor or in a particular stream. Some also propose to recall this string without printing it. In short, undeniably, printf is a vital function. In this Hive Helsinki project, I recoded printf function and added it to my libft library so that I can use it in all my future projects.

The versatility of the printf function in C represents a great exercise in programming. This project is of moderate difficulty. It enabled me to discover variadic functions in C in a particularly relevant context. 

The key to a successful ft_printf is a well-structured and good extensible code. This is because as time goes by, I will continue to extend my ft_printf, making my life easier for any future projects.
